This folder contains customs steps. You can find a video tutorial on how to use them on my channel: https://youtu.be/dnQXLKEp5g4

Customs steps can be used in SAS Studio Flows. They provide mini-UIs for any SAS / Python code and can be used like any other officially supported node in a analysis flow. 

The steps are
1. runModelLocal -> score input data with a model published to CAS publishing destination.
2. Copy data -> copy data between libraries
3. Sample data -> simple example on how to use python inside a custom step
